the mod json file itself needs to have the same name as the folder its inside of, except with a mod_ suffix.
like so:

mods/asdasd/mod_asdasd.json
mods/testmod/mod_testmod.json



modding biomes is easy; in the biomes_modname.json, you will have to reference your assets and such.
also the nameing follows the same spirit, like so:

mods/asdasd/biomes_asdasd.json
mods/testmod/biomes_testmod.json
